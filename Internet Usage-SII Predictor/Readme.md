# Predicting Problematic Internet Usage in Children and Adolescents

This project aims to predict the level of problematic internet usage (PIU) exhibited by children and adolescents based on their physical activity and fitness data. By identifying early signs of PIU, we can encourage timely interventions to foster healthier digital habits among young individuals.
